# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

## OBJECTIVE
This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System that uses natural language processing techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. The model processes movie features such as genre, keywords, tagline, cast, and director to compute similarity scores and recommend movies.
## DATA SOURCE
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains a wide range of information about movies. You can find the dataset [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/main/Movies%20Recommendation.csv).

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
-Python: For data processing and model implementation.  <br>
-Pandas: For efficient data handling and manipulation.  <br>
-NumPy: For numerical computations.  <br>
-Scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity computation.  <br>

## EXPLAINATION
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that uses a content-based filtering approach to suggest movies. The recommendations are generated by analyzing the content of movies, such as their genre, cast, director, tagline, and keywords.

### Steps Involved:
1. *Data Preprocessing:*

-The raw dataset is loaded, and key features such as Movie_Genre, Movie_Keywords, Movie_Tagline, Movie_Cast, and Movie_Director are selected.
-Missing values in these features are handled by replacing them with an empty string. <br>
2. *Feature Engineering:* 

-The selected features are combined into a single string for each movie to create a comprehensive textual representation of the movie's content.<br>
3. *Text Vectorization:*

-The combined textual data is converted into numerical form using the TF-IDF Vectorizer, which measures the importance of each word relative to the entire dataset. This ensures that common words have lower weights, while unique words have higher weights.   <br>
4. *Similarity Calculation:*

-The Cosine Similarity technique is used to calculate the similarity between movies based on their vectorized representations. This method provides a score between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates greater similarity.  <br>
5. *Recommendation Generation:*

-When a user provides a movie title, the system identifies similar movies by ranking them based on their cosine similarity scores. The top results are then recommended to the user.  <br>
